\section{An unpromising topic?} % (fold)
\label{sec:an_unpromising_topic_}

Aristotle on transparency can seem like an unpromising topic. Many commentators have been unkind. Some commentators have suggested that Aristotle's account is of antiquarian interest only. Others have expressed incredulity at the way Aristotle's account conflicts with the manifest facts of experience. So why write about Aristotle on transparency?

In a transparent medium, such as air or water, objects can appear in or through that medium. This is a remarkable fact. (Though, perhaps, one we may have grown jaded about in our hypervisual culture). As we shall see, this remarkable fact about transparency is bound up with an ancient puzzle or \emph{aporia} about the nature of sensory presentation at work in color vision. This puzzle animates Empedocles' account of color vision. Moreover, as I argue at length in (ref), Aristotle's notorious definition of perception as the assimilation of the sensible form of an object without its matter is a dialectical response to this puzzlement.

\section{A puzzle about perception at a distance} % (fold)
\label{sec:a_puzzle_about_perception_at_a_distance}

In \emph{La Dioptrique}, Descartes makes the striking and paradoxical comparison between vision and a blind man's use of sticks in navigation, a kind of haptic touch (see Figure~\ref{fig:blind}). The analogy is, in fact, an ancient one. Alexander of Aphrodisias attributes it to the Stoics (\emph{De Anima} 130 14). The Stoic analogy was criticized by Galen in \emph{De Placitis Hippocratis et Plotonis} 2.5, 2.7, and by Tideus in \emph{De Speculis}. Though an ancient analogy, Descartes makes distinctively modern use of it. Thus, for example, Descartes not only uses the analogy to motivate his mechanical account of vision but also in support of the claim that there need be nothing in objects that resemble the ideas or sensations that we have of them. Just as the Stoic use of the analogy had its critics, so too the Cartesian use. Thus Merleau-Ponty complains:
\begin{quote}
	The blind, says Descartes, ‘see with their hands’. Cartesian concept of vision is modeled after the sense of touch. At one swoop, then, he removes action at a distance and relieves us of that ubiquity which is the whole problem of vision (as well as its peculiar virtue). \citep[170]{Merleau-Ponty:1964aa}
\end{quote}

\end{figure}

What is it about vision that constitutes the whole problem of vision as well as its peculiar virtue? Merleau-Ponty describes vision as a kind of action at a distance. This can suggest that the problem concerns the causal mechanisms that underly visual perception. This is misleading, however. Given the state of optical knowledge even at the time of Merleau-Ponty's writing, there was no serious question whether visual perception involved action at a distance. Light reflected, transmitted, and emitted from the scene travels to the perceiver and so ``irradiates their sensory surfaces'', in Quine's deflationary phrase. In speaking of vision as a kind of action at a distance, Merleau-Ponty was not denying the existence of a proximal cause for vision, rather he was making a phenomenological observation, that vision presents us with objects located at a distance.
